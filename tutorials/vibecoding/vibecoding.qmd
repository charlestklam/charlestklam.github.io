# Why Interactive Dashboards? {background-color="#09443fff"}

## How we usually visualize data

- Static charts in papers or slides
- Screenshots from Excel or SPSS; Output from 
- Fixed perspectives (the reader sees only what we chose to show) 
- Linear storytelling (one path through the data) 


## Benefits for Research Communication

1. Readers can explore on their own, enhancing transparency
2. This can better engage readers with hands-on interaction
3. Reusable: Keep the same tool for different (sub)sets of data (we typically have the same set of methods and visualization across projects)


## Benefits for Teaching & Learning

1. Immediate response with users adjust parameters 
2. Scaffold discovery without over-prescribing
3. Data-Driven Learning (DDL) — Students explore corpus data directly

## The "Vibe Coding" Boom 

### What changed in 2025?
- AI assistants can generate larger chunks of working code from natural language
- No-code/low-code platforms reduce barriers
- **Free deployment options** make sharing easy
- The barrier is no longer technical — it's our own imagination


## Vibe Coding = Coding by Vibes

### The term (coined by Andrej Karpathy, Feb 2025)

> "There's a new kind of coding I call "vibe coding", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists."

Source: [https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383?lang=en]

. . .

**In practice:**

- Describe what you want in plain English (or others languages really)
- AI generates the code
- You refine through conversation iteratively**
- Deploy without deep technical knowledge**???**

- "Forget that the code even exists" is not impossible, but knowing the logic / structure / code is actually quite desirable for speed and precision. 
- AI-assisted coding does help **learning** how to code

## Why It Matters for Language Researchers

- Textual data are not always transparent for data scientists  
- Think **narratives** -- the story you want to tell in the research 


# Demo of Live Applications {background-color="#09443f"}

## Demo 1: Biomedical Science Corpus Dashboard

### Qualitative Methods Dashboard

A data dashboard for exploring a corpus of academic writing in biomedical science.

Built with Replit (plus some Python)

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
## Visit: 
[qualitiative-methods-dashboard.replit.app](https://qualitiative-methods-dashboard.replit.app/)

Click **"Use Biomedical Dataset"** to start exploring.
:::

## Demo 1: Key Features

- Browse corpus texts by discipline or text type
- Search for patterns across the collection
- Visualize distributions of linguistic features
- Compare subsets of the data
- Export findings for further analysis


## Demo 2: Move-Step Analysis Tool

A tool to display rhetorical progression in the Methods section of science writing.

Built with Google AI Studio

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
## AnnotateLab
[annotatelab-860580144856.us-west1.run.app](https://annotatelab-860580144856.us-west1.run.app/)

Click **"Display annotation"** (top right) — expect 4-5 seconds loading time.
:::

## Demo 2: Key Features


- Move-Step Analysis — rhetorical structure visualization
- AI-assisted annotation — automatic identification of moves
- Visual progression — see how methods sections unfold
- Pattern discovery — compare across texts

## Exercise 1: Simple One-Liner Prompts

### Try these examples (5 mins)

Copy and paste these prompts to see what AI can generate:

. . .

**Non-language data:**

> "Create a simple web app that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit"

> "Build a to-do list app with the ability to mark tasks as complete"

> "Build a visualizer to display quadratic equations."


## Exercise 1: Language-Related Prompts

**For language data:**

. . .

> "Create a word frequency counter that shows a bar chart of the top 10 words. The input text box goes to the left hand side. Allow the user to upload a txt file within 1MB." 

. . .

> "Build a simple concordancer that shows a keyword in context."

. . .

> "Make a readability calculator that computes Flesch-Kincaid score."

## From exercise 1: Observe these aspects:

- Speed — How fast can you get a working prototype?
- Iteration — Try saying "make the chart blue" or "add a download button" **after** the first iteration
- Limitations — What doesn't work as expected? 
- Refinement — How specific does your prompt need to be?


## Exercise 2: Create your own prompt 

### Come up with a tool that would **tell your story**, e.g.:

::: {.columns}
- Keyword comparison tool
- Collocation visualizer
- POS tag distribution chart
- Sentiment timeline

:::

Use the many tricks in prompt engineering: **Chain-of-Thoughts**, **metaprompting**, **references** (with images or links) 

## Key Points for Effective Prompts

1. What it does — Clear description of functionality and goal
2. What data it uses — Input format (text? CSV? user upload?)
3. What output you want — Charts? Tables? Images? Downloadable files?
4. User interaction — Buttons? Filters? Text input?
5. Visual style — Clean? Colorful? Minimalist?
6. Reference — Include some links or images for inspiration 

## Example: A Well-Crafted Prompt

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="35%"}

**Vague:**

> "Make a word frequency tool"

::: 

::: {.column width="65%"}

**Better:**

> "Create a web app where users can paste text into a box. Use a clean, professional design with a blue color scheme. 
When they click 'Analyze', show:

1. A bar chart of the 15 most frequent words (excluding stopwords)

2. A table with word, frequency, and percentage

3. A download button to save results as CSV. "

## On finding References & Inspiration

### Where to look:

- Existing tools 
- Research papers — What visualizations have you seen in your field? You can also instruct the coding agent to use specific packages
- Colleagues — Describe what you want to someone else
- AI itself — Ask: "What are common ways to visualize corpus data? Give me 5 options for X."


## Troubleshooting Tips

### When things don't work:

- Be more specific — Add details about what went wrong
- Break it down — "First, just make the file upload work"
- Ask for explanation — "Explain why the chart is not showing" (CoT prompting)
- Try alternatives — "Use a different charting library"
- Iterate — Refinement is part of the process
